 * Master Mode SPI Controller for the dsPIC33F
 *
 *    by Humphrey Hu
 *
 * Revisions:
 *  Humphrey Hu         2011-11-10    Initial implemetation
 *                      
 * Usage:
 *        
 * This module serves as a wrapper for DMA-enabled SPI. Data is transferred
 * and received in "transactions," which can be started and ended with the 
 * respective function calls.
 *
 * Buffer and port configuration is in spi_controller.c
 * 
 * Ex:
 *  spi1BeginTransaction();
 *  // Transfer/Receive methods here
 *  spi1EndTransaction();
 *
 * Data transfer and reception methods come in synchronous single-byte 
 * and asynchronous mass-transfer varieties: 
 *
 * The synchronous methods return once the data (a single byte) has been 
 * read/written, and is useful for small transactions where the overhead of 
 * buffering is prohibitive, or when timing is critical.
 *
 * The asynchronous methods return once the target data has been buffered,
 * and continue the transaction in the background without using processor resources.
 * Once the transaction is complete, the registered callback is executed with a
 * interrupt source flag. This method of transfer is useful for large transactions
 * where transferring the data synchronously would consume too much processor time.
